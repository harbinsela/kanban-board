# Kanban Board

A simple **frontend-only Kanban Board** built with **Vite**, **JavaScript**, and **SortableJS** for drag-and-drop functionality. Manage your work items by creating boards and cards, and easily organize them with a smooth drag-and-drop interface.

---

## Features

- **Boards**: Create, rename, and delete boards.  
- **Cards**: Create cards with title, description, and severity. Delete them if needed.  
- **Drag & Drop**: Move cards across boards using drag-and-drop powered by SortableJS.  
- **Persistence**: All data is saved in the browser using `localStorage`, so your boards and cards remain after refreshing.
